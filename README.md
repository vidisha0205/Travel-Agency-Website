# Travel-Agency-Website
This project uses the 4 components of MERN, i.e. MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS, to develop an online travel agency website.
MongoDB Cloud is used as the database here, whereas Express and Node are used in the backend. ReactJS is used in the frontend.
The website makes provisions for customers to sign-up with any destination plan they prefer and offers them a list of choices to choose from.
It also fetched further details incase anyone is interested in further details regarding a certain plan from the database.
